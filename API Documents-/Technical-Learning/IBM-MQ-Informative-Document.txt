This Document gives the Basic overview of the IBM-MQ usage in the mulesoft:

IBM-MQ is one of  Message Queing Service similar to other queing services like JMS-Apache-ActiveMq.
The Main purpose of this Queing services are publishing the message to a queue or a Topic/exchange
and consume the message(Data) where-ever necessary in the inter and intra-Application level.

Below are the Mandatory configurations for the IBM-Mq

host=
port=
queuename=
queuemanager=
channel=
username=
password=

All the Above configuration details will be provided my the IBM-Mq team of the Organisation.

-> Just as JMS-services we have messaging operations like

   publish, publish-Consume, onNew-Message(source-connector), consume

By default we wont be able to see the IBM-MQ module in the mule pallete
we have to import it from the exchange.

like all the other messaging servies, the IBM_MQ also performs the similar operations.

The Data from the upstream systems are captured and sent to the various destination queues or topics.

Refer Mulesoft Documentation for more information.
