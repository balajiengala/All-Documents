Exposing-Feilds: 
Based on the feilds assosciated to the Particular client the feilds are Exposed :- version: V2 DataWeave Script Snippet
In this Script, i have used a Custom defined function to expose and hide the Feilds.


Dw Script:


%dw 2.0
output application/json skipNullOn="everywhere"
var APiResponse = vars.APiResponse
fun check(respData)= if((respData == "Resident_ID") and (payload.FeildList contains "Resident_ID")) (APiResponse.ResultDataList reduce $).Resident_ID 
else if((respData == "Benf_Name") and (payload.FeildList contains "Benf_Name")) (APiResponse.ResultDataList reduce $).Benf_Name 
else if((respData == "District_Name") and (payload.FeildList contains "District_Name")) (APiResponse.ResultDataList reduce $).District_Name 
else if((respData == "Taluk_Name") and (payload.FeildList contains "Taluk_Name")) (APiResponse.ResultDataList reduce $).Taluk_Name
